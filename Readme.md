# 4d-widgets

4D widgets are functionalities provided as components that can be accessed from the Form editor and/or the preconfigured object library. These widgets are compound objects with predefined characteristics. They provide access to standard functions and are very simple to implement.

Three widgets are available:
* SearchPicker: search area with standard appearance.
* DatePicker: date selector.
* TimePicker: time selector.
